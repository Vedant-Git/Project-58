        <p> My hobby is reading books that are fun and knowlegdeable because it is like a journy to another world. When I come home after school or when I go to sleep, I read my books so that I can have a fresh mind the next day. I am 11 years old in the 6th grade. I feel better when I read so I am happy every day. Reading is also a very good habit to build. It can help with your knowledge and can give you something to do during you free time. It can make you busy and not make you glued to your screens It can make you diceplind, loyal, puncual, and most importantly, a successful person in life.</p>
